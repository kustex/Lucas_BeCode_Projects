## Plot 2: Beats per minute compared to energy of all the songs and popularity.
Plot 2 shows that there is not really a relation between the energy of the songs and the BPM (Beats per minute) of a song. 
On the other hand, the scatterplot shows that when there is more energy in a song, it is more likely that is more popular.
